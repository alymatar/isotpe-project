            <h2>Economics of Isotope Production</h2>
            <p>In international trade, isotopes are divided into two product groups: artificial radioactive isotopes (ARIs) and artificial stable isotopes (ASIs). The structure of Russian exports is quite stable and changes slowly over time.</p>
            <p>World trade in RI and IRI in monetary terms is correlated as 5:1. At least half of the isotopes are for medical purposes (the rest is for industry and research, where demand is stable), so global changes in export and import flows, to a first approximation, reflect the medical component of the global isotope business.</p>
            <p>In recent years, global exports and imports of Iran amounted to just over $1 billion per year. The list of exporters is headed by Canada, the USA, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany. The list of importers is led by the USA, Japan, Germany, England, and China.</p>
            <p>Russia today accounts for 6% of world exports and 1% of imports. The dynamics of international trade between Iran and Russia show significant growth in exports over 15 years - more than threefold! Imports have been stable in recent years.</p>

            <h2>Isotopic Tracers in Industry</h2>
            <p>In industry, isotope tracers are used to study material transport in processes where particle flow and mixing are of greatest interest to both designers and operating personnel. The use of isotope indication methods in factory conditions clearly shows that economic benefits can be obtained both at the start-up stage of the enterprise and when improving the performance characteristics of equipment.</p>
            <p>At the 500,000 t/year oil refinery in Wilton (UK), the use of radioisotopes had a significant impact upon its start-up. Between 1984 and 1986, the IAEA and UNDP plan to organize three training courses and three workshops on isotope detection technology under a regional cooperation agreement.</p>

            <h2>Geological Exploration and Mining of Minerals</h2>
            <p>The coal and oil industries have readily embraced nuclear techniques, which help improve efficiency and reduce costs from well drilling to raw material extraction and refining. These industries now make extensive use of radioisotope techniques, perhaps more than any other industry.</p>
            <p>New borehole logging techniques that allow direct measurement of uranium deposits are already becoming common methods in uranium mining. Nuclear methods are now increasingly used in geological exploration and development of minerals such as aluminum and bauxite, copper, and cobalt.</p>

            <h2>Production of Stable Isotopes</h2>
            <p>The production of stable isotopes (deuterium, boron isotopes, beryllium, etc.) for the needs of the nuclear industry has long been carried out on an industrial scale. Recently, the demand for stable isotopes for medical purposes has increased sharply. The stable isotope of oxygen 18O is used for early diagnosis of cancer using positron emission tomography (PET) scanners.</p>
            <p>Recently, the Oximed company (Roshchino) began its industrial production. The project is designed to produce 10 kg of the 18O oxygen isotope per year, all products are exported.</p>
            <p>The need for mass use of medical preparations labeled with the 13C isotope for diagnostic purposes requires a significant increase in its global production to hundreds of kg per year. Unfortunately, the cost of obtaining it using traditional methods is very high. More promising in this sense is laser technology for separating stable isotopes of medium-mass elements, which makes it possible to significantly reduce costs in the production of the 13C isotope.</p>

            <h2>Production of Isotopes in Nuclear Reactors</h2>
            <p>As is known, weapons-grade isotopes, and primarily 239Pu, are produced in industrial nuclear reactors specially designed for these purposes. Recently, active reconstruction of “military” reactors has begun in order to expand the production of “peaceful” isotopes (both stable and radioactive), primarily for medical purposes.</p>
            <p>Among the so-called reactor group of isotopes, the radioactive, gamma-emitting isotope cobalt-60 has an important place. Radiation modification of the properties of polymers and products. Irradiation installations using cobalt-60 as a source of gamma radiation are widely used in many sectors of the economy and are intended in particular for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sterilization of food (to preserve crops, meat, and eggs)</li>
                <li>Sterilization of medical instruments and materials</li>
                <li>Stimulation of growth and productivity of grain and vegetable crops</li>
                <li>Disinfection and purification of industrial and domestic wastewater, solid waste from various types of production</li>
                <li>Refining and strengthening wood products</li>
                <li>Strengthening of various types of special-purpose glass and its coloring</li>
                <li>Radiation treatment of various polymer products to give them new consumer properties</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Gamma sterilizers of various capacities are used in hospitals, clinics, airports, and farms for antimicrobial treatment of various products and materials, pre-sowing treatment of seeds, various agricultural products, and stimulation of the growth of fish and bird embryos. Bioradiation and radiation-chemical technologies are used to process biopolymers into high-value products: baker's and feed yeast; alcohols, feed, and sorbents.</p>
            <p>The production of isotopes in nuclear reactors is a significant part of the Russian economy, with extensive production facilities built during the USSR era. These facilities are being updated and expanded to meet growing demands, particularly in the medical field.</p>
